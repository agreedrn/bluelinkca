## Background
This is a wrapper built to use Hyundai Bluelink (which does not have a API) simply and effectively. It is a personal project of mine, as I have a 2024 Hyundai Elantra.

I built this because I realized what a pain it is to lock your car every time with the digital key, and forgetting all the time. The original goal was to build an alexa skill, which I am, but I decided since I am going to anyway, why not create a public API that makes manipulating Bluelink Canada easy.

Keep in mind, this is a **workaround**. Bluelink has no offical API, so I am taking advantage of their inner site API, which is quite easy to use, to create this. This is a fun, personal project, to help resolve a highly specific pet peeve of mine.
