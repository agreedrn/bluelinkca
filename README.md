# pybluelinkca

[!CAUTION]
This project is not completed/ready to use, and still in development. This is not an offical API/Wrapper.

[!WARNING]
This only works for **CANADIAN BLUELINK USERS**

> This is a wrapper built to use Hyundai Bluelink **CANADA** (which does not have a API) simply and effectively. It is a personal project of mine, as I have a 2024 Hyundai Elantra. It works through python requests, and is a **workaround**. Again, this is not an offical API/Wrapper, and in no means should be treated like one. Regardless, I hope this is enjoyable to use and deploy, and I am personally working on making an unoffical alexa skill for Canadian bluelink users, as only US users get the alexa skill
